# Circle lines

Another simple looping animation made with bars and circles.

The looping function works thanks to [jwagner's awesome simplex noise library](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js).
The bars are then slightly offset and coloured with a light shade, in order to emulate some fake color aberration *(because I think it looks cool and retro)*.
Everything is built on top of my boilerplate for [HTML5 canvas](https://github.com/lorossi/empty-html5-canvas-project).

There's is not much to say, but if you're curious, make sure to check my [Instagram profile!](https://instagram.com/lorossi97) to see what I like to do!
